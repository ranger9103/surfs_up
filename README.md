# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview
Evaluating temperatures in Oahu year round will help determine if surfing and ice cream are commodities people would seek out throughout the year.

## Results
-The temperature in Oahu is consistent year round with only about a 4 degree difference between June and December. 
-The minimum temperatures fluctuate somewhat more at a variation of 8 degrees.
-The max temperature is only different by 2. 

## Summary
 Oahu is a location that may be ammenable to a surf and ice cream shop from a weather perspective. Things are looking promising for W. Avy's venture. From this data set another query could include more focused location data, evaluating which side of the island may have the best weather options. Going forward, looking at the number of surf shops, areas with good surfing, and areas with parking options would be important aspects to determine.
