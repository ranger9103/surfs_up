## Summary
 Oahu is a location that may be ammenable to a surf and ice cream shop from a weather perspective. Things are looking promising for W. Avy's venture. From this data set another query could include more focused location data, evaluating which side of the island may have the best weather options. Going forward, looking at the number of surf shops, areas with good surfing, and areas with parking options would be important aspects to determine.
